Hi There, 
 
I’m William, a current undergraduate student at the University of Sydney studying Mechatronic Engineering and Finance.

I’m currently learning Power Electronics, including how to operate a DC motor using a single phase AC power supply with a H-Bridge Rectifier and PWM signal from a microcontroller (In this case its a Arduino Uno). Im also learning how to perform Automoated Vision inspection using machine vision and Data Aquisition Instruments.
